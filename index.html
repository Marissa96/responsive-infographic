<h2>Recreational Anglers in Canada</h2>
<p>in 2005, more than 3.2 million adults bought licences and fished for recreation in Canada. Trends show that these numbers have decreased at an average annual rate of 2% during the past ten years.</p>
<p>Approximately 8/10, or 2.5 million, anglers fished within their home province or territory. The remaining population of recreational anglers consisited of about 628,000 visitors to Canada and also just over 150,000 Canadians who fished outside their home province or territory. This article focuses only upon those active anglers who finished within their own province, known as “resident anglers”.</p>

<h2>Fishing Hot Spots in Canada</h2>
<p>Great Bear Lake</p>
<p>Lake Athabasca</p>
<p>Fraser River</p>
<p>Lake Waskaiowaka</p>
<p>Lake Winnipeg</p>
<p>Lake Nipissing</p>
<p>Lake Erie</p>
<p>Otty Lake</p>
<p>North Lake</p>
<p>Cascapedia River</p>

<h2>Where are These Anglers?</h2>
<p>Approximately 3/4 of active anglers live in Ontario, Quebec or British Columbia. When the proportion of the adult population engaged in recreational fishing is analyzed by province, a varied portrait emerges.</p>

<p>Nationally, about one in every ten Canadian adults were active anglers. In Newfoundland and Labrador, almost one third of the adult population were active anglers. The other provinces where the participation rates were higher than the national rate were Yukon, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Quebec. In Nunavut, only 4% of the adult population participated in recreational fishing</p>
